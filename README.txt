BINARY-TO-DECIMAL NUMBER CONVERTER



This is a simple binary-to-decimal converter, created simply as means to study and further myself, mainly in JS coding,
since it's my first app without any direct aid from a professor/mentor.

It may, as well, show a little bit of my progression as I study more and more.



With inspiration from florinpop17/app-ideas on github, I decided to build it with the exact rules set by his challenge.

By doing so, there are some implementations that were left undone, such as making the converter a two way route, able 
to process decimal's as well and give it's binary counterpart.



I do not intend on coming back to this project in some time (only if some interesting solutions come by to build it differently).

It was built entirely from plain html/css/js.




Credits to florinpop17!!! I may try other of his project ideas.
